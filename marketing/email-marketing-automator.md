    goal: Activate user
    cta: Complete first action

### Cart Abandonment Sequence

```javascript
const abandonmentFlow = {
  trigger: 'cart_abandoned',
  emails: [
    {
      delay: '1 hour',
      subject: 'Did you forget something?',
      content: 'Your items are waiting',
      incentive: 'none'
    },
    {
      delay: '24 hours',

      content: 'Customer reviews + urgency',
      incentive: 'free shipping'
    },
    {
      delay: '72 hours',
      subject: 'Last chance: 15% off your cart',
      content: 'Discount + scarcity',
      incentive: '15% discount',
      expires: '24 hours'
    }
  ],
  stop_condition: 'purchase_completed'
};
```

### Segmentation Strategy

```sql
-- High-value segment
SELECT email FROM users
WHERE lifetime_value > 500
  AND last_purchase < 30_days_ago
  AND engagement_score > 0.7;

-- Churn risk segment
SELECT email FROM users
WHERE last_login > 14_days_ago
  AND subscription_ends < 30_days
  AND support_tickets > 2;

-- Power users segment
SELECT email FROM users
WHERE daily_active_days > 20
  AND features_used > 10
  AND referrals_made > 0;
```

### A/B Test Framework

```typescript
interface EmailTest {
  variants: {
    control: {
      subject: 'New features are here';
      preheader: "Check out what's new";
      cta: 'Explore Now';
    };
    variant_a: {
      subject: 'You asked, we delivered 🚀';
      preheader: 'Your requested features are live';
      cta: "See What's New";
    };
  };
  audience_split: [50, 50];
  success_metric: 'click_rate';
  minimum_sample: 1000;
  confidence_level: 0.95;
}
```

### Dark Mode Email CSS

<style>
  /* Light mode (default) */
  .email-container {
    background: #ffffff;
    color: #000000;
  }
